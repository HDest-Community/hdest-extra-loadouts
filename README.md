# Extra Loadout Slots (for Hideous Destructor)
A [Hideous Destructor](https://codeberg.org/mc776/HideousDestructor) mod.<br>
Originally created by HexaDoken.

Extra loadout slots. Doesn't get as simple as this.<br>
Default one has 100 loadout slots, but there exists other branches with 50 loadouts and 30 loadouts.

The **main** branch contains 100 loadout slots.<br>
The two other branches, **50-loadouts** and **30-loadouts**, should be self-explanatory.

Load before **Ugly as Sin**, if loaded.<br>
Or else the Ugly as Sin Settings will not show!
